Hi there! I’m an applied microeconomist with a focus on behavioral and experimental economics. During my PhD I combined theory and experimental evidence to structure and guide analysis. My research interests are quite varied: I have worked on the interaction between concerns for animal welfare and prosocial behavior towards human beings, understanding under which circumstances customer-driven pricing mechanisms work, and on examining whether context influences decision making in a speed dating experiment.

I like to travel, cook, brew beer, read, and most importantly play the bassoon and contrabassoon. I’m actively participating in several orchestras. I’m also one of the founding members of [Aulos Klangakademie](https://www.aulos-klangakademie.de), which organizes an annual one-week choir and orchestra camp.

I am currently working at [BSS Economic Consultants](https://www.bss-basel.ch), where I focus on causal inference, econometric analysis and data science. Up until 2017, I was a research and teaching assistant at the chair of Prof. Dr. Klaus M. Schmidt at LMU Munich, where I received my doctorate. Prior to that, I completed an M.Sc. in Economics at LMU Munich, and a B.A. in Economics at the University of St. Gallen.
